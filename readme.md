## Prompt

Create a HTML/CSS/JS based front end which has 2 boxes.
one box to select one of the 3 check-boxes (cat, dog, elephant)
one box to upload any file
If one selects cat or dog or elephant in the first box, then show a photo of cat, dog, or elephant (you can store this locally as well)
If one uploads any file, then respond back with its name, file-size, and type
You must use Flask as the backend to achieve this
Create a more intuitive, user-friendly, and visually appealing UI, we can enhance the layout with some modern design touches like shadow effects, improved button styling, and distinct sections.
